This Repositary contains Brand Radiator Test ,  both front end and backend  folder , i have hosted front end using netlify , which shows the preview but to use complete app features 
you have to run the app ,
I have added all the mention features and added some additional features like 
-- Shimmer 
-- Redux toolkit 
--Toggle  Menu functionality
and Contact us page contains a form which takes name email password and message and adds that into mongoose , and admin page has a login page , if you login successfully then
you can view the data submitted in the contact form , i have implemented this using reduc toolkit
and if you click on any icon in the sidenav  then it automatically close the side nav bar until you click on the ham menu icon
Iam sharing front end Repositary as well , please have a look at it ,
